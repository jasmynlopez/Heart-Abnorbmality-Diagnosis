# Heart-Abnormality-Diagnosis
Implementation of the logistic regression learning algorithm to diagnose heart abnormalities based on tomography (X-ray). The data used is from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Data Repository and was collected by Lukasz Kurgan and Krzysztof Cios. Data was split into training and testing data sets, composed of 80 and 187 data vectors respectively, with each data vector contains 22 binary input features. 




Each input vector represents data extracted from the X-ray of one patient’s heart.
There are 22 binary input features. The output class value represents the diagnosis of the patient’s
heart (normal or abnormal, encoded in binary). The training data set contains 80 data vectors, and
the testing data set contains 187 data vectors.
(Thanks to Lukasz Kurgan and Krzysztof Cios for providing this data to the UC Irvine Machine Learning Data Repository.)
