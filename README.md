This repository contains my implementation of the logistic regression learning algorithm to diagnose heart abnormalities based on tomography (X-ray). The data used is from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Data Repository and was collected by Lukasz Kurgan and Krzysztof Cios. Data was split into training and testing data sets, composed of 80 and 187 data vectors respectively, with each data vector contains 22 binary input features. Finally, the output class indicates (in binary) the diagnosis either as normal or abnormal.
